		<p class="p2">&#11162;Hi, I'm Parthiban. I'm working as a Data Analyst at Objectways<br> Technologies and also studying Full-Stack web development.<br>&#9656;I completed my SSLC in 2014 with 86%.<br>&#9656;I completed my Higher Secondary in 2017 with 75%.<br>&#9656;I completed my BE-Electrical and Electronical Engineering<br>at N.S.N College of Engineering and Technology with 7.48 CGP.<br>&#9656;Now I have one year experience as a Data Analyst.<br>Also I'm currently studying Full-Stack webdevelopment.</p><br>
		<p class="p7">&#11162;I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself<br>by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent.<br>I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do<br> interesting things that matter.</p><br>
		<p class="p3">&#11162;Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm,<br>I'm easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations<br>wherever they take me.I'm passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit<br>with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I'm never satisfied to just<br>come up with ideas.</p><br>
		<p class="p4">&#11162;My abundant energy fuels me in pursuit of many interests, hobbies,<br>areas of study and artistic endeavors. I'm a fast learner, able to pick up<br>new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.</p><br>
		<p class="p5">&#11162;I like to develop new things using new technologies like HTML, CSS,<br>and JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS etc.. Here I'm attached my GitHub<br> link for your referance and also attached my projects.</p><br>
